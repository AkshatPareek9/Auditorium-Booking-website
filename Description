We have given a project to make a website on Auditorium and Seminar Hall booking system using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
We are making a website with four group members on the Auditorium and Seminar Hall booking system in which we have divided four modules:
1.	HOME PAGE INCLUDING ABOUT US AND CONTACT US
2.	ADMIN PAGE
3.	USER LOGIN
4.	BOOKING AND VIEW BOOKING REQUEST

HOME PAGE 
We are make a home page for our website where we have gave an option to user to open our website and click on login to log into their account.
We also gave an option to admin to update and delete anything in the website.
Next one is very important in the home page is that we gave a best option to every user to give their suggestion or feedback according to their behaviour towards our website.

ADMIN PAGE
Here in this firstly admin login to their ID and then two options are shown to admin:
1.	Updating 
2.	View bookings
In updating, admin tell us the website about new hall details includes:
 Auditorium ID, seats, cost and address
In view bookings, admin can see the booked halls by user or we can say that admin has the access to view the booked halls of the user.

USER LOGIN
If a new user wants to login to our website then he has to create its new account by click on sign in and then he gave his details along with a username and a password.
Then after creating account, user login to their account and start to book the halls according to their needs.
Gallery is also available in every user account to gave a view of seminar halls.

BOOKING AND VIEW BOOKING REQUEST
User can book their halls which are available in their account and pay according to their cost.
If a user booked any hall he has the right to view their booking status.
