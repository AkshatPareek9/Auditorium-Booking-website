# Auditorium-Booking-website
The main objective of the project on online seminar hall and auditorium booking system is to track the status of auditorium and advance bookings using user login ID. The system auditorium management software includes all the features and functions needed to efficiently manage an auditorium. It includes an administrator account which is used to handle or control all the system functionality. The system keeps track of auditorium status and advance bookings. The system keeps records of auditorium bookings along with associated event details and customer contacts in a well maintained database. The administrator can easily check the auditorium bookings and timings in the system graphical user interface(GUI). The system also notifies when new event timing draws near or clash them.
